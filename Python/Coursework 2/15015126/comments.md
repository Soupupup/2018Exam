Without implementing numpy, as seen in "perf_plot.png", the time increases expotentially as the the number of iteration steps completed (number of nodes generated) increases.

With the numpy implementation, the time taken also has an expotentially growth but with a significiantly smaller rate of increase in gradient than the non-numpy version. (harder to tell with a large time axis with both graphs, if looking at the numpy-verison separately, it's easier to tell that it also grows expotentially). 

Additionally, note that at first, before and including the 7 iteration steps, the no-numpy version is actually faster than the numpy-version. Only after 7 interation steps, the time taken of the no-numpy version grows expotentially at a larger rate then the numpy-version (non-numpy slower by a factor of around 6 at 10 iterations than numpy)
